# Optimizing Airplane Boarding and Disembarking

This project was developed for the International Mathematical Modeling Challenge (IMMC) 2022, where it earned the Meritorious Prize and achieved 8th place overall, the best performance in the history of Vietnamese participation. It focuses on creating mathematical models and simulations to optimize airplane boarding and disembarking times. Our models aim to improve efficiency by considering various factors such as passenger behavior, seating arrangements, and baggage handling.

## Key Features

1. **Mathematical Models**
   - Predicts boarding and disembarking times for three common airplane types: Narrow-Body, Flying Wing, and Two Entrances-Two Aisles (TETA).

2. **Simulations**
   - Implements virtual timers to simulate real-world passenger behavior during boarding and disembarking processes.

3. **Optimal Strategies**
   - **Boarding**: Evaluates methods such as Random Boarding, Sectional Boarding, and Outside-In Boarding.
   - **Disembarking**: Demonstrates the efficiency of column-based passenger exit strategies.
   - **COVID-19 Adjustments**: Adapts seating and boarding strategies for varying capacity levels (e.g., 70%, 50%, 30%) under social distancing rules.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For building simulations and conducting experiments.
- **NumPy & Matplotlib**: For data processing and visualizations.

## Results
The findings indicate that:
- The widely-used Back-to-Front boarding strategy is less efficient than Random Boarding.
- Outside-In Boarding and column-based disembarking methods are more effective.
- The models provide adaptable solutions for different airplane layouts and pandemic restrictions.

## References
The project integrates insights from published research and simulation data to validate the models.
